This is the documentation for the VoteAmerica suite of tools.

We provide publically available [election information data](api/index.md), and [embeddable tools](embed/index.md) for voters to check their registration, get registered, request an absentee or vote-by-mail ballot, find their polling place, and contact their local elections office.
