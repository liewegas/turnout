This is the documentation for the VoteAmerica suite of tools.

We provide publically available [election information data](api/index.md), and [embeddable tools](embed/index.md) for voters to check their registration, get registered, request an absentee or vote-by-mail ballot, find their polling place, and contact their local elections office.

To get these tools for your website, you can use the [free embed codes](embed/free.md) or sign up for our [premium subscriptions](https://premium.voteamerica.com/) to be able to access the data.
